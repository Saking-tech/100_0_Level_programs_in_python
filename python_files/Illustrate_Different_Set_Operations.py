# Program to illustrate set operations

# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union
print("Union of set1 and set2:", set1.union(set2))

# Intersection
print("Intersection of set1 and set2:", set1.intersection(set2))

# Difference
print("Difference of set1 and set2:", set1.difference(set2))

# Symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of set1 and set2:", set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
